With Blipsqueak, you can set different notification sounds for different types of messages. For example, a short chirp for one word messages or and ascending tone for messages that end with a question mark.

Create profiles to define the types of message that you want to hear about, and pick a sound to play for each one. When a message arrives that matches one of your profiles, the associated sound is played.
